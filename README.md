## Notes

- **Real event data collection**: Spent time researching actual Philadelphia events with accurate dates, times, locations, and official promotional images rather than using placeholder content.

- **Responsive grid layout**: Fine-tuned the CSS Grid `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))` to ensure cards display beautifully across all screen sizes while maintaining readability and visual appeal.
